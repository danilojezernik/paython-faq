## Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort - Simple sorting algorithm with O(n^2) complexity.
2. Insertion Sort - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, O(n^2) complexity.
3. Selection Sort - Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted part, O(n^2) complexity.
4. Merge Sort - A divide and conquer algorithm, O(n log n) complexity.
5. Quick Sort - Another divide and conquer algorithm, average O(n log n) complexity.

## Searching Algorithms
1. Linear Search - Searches for an element sequentially, O(n) complexity.
2. Binary Search - Searches in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, O(log n) complexity.

## Tips for Preparation
1. Understand the Time and Space Complexity - Be able to explain the Big-O notation for your algorithms.
2. Practice Coding - Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.
3. Mock Interviews - Practice with friends or use online mock interview platforms.
4. Explain Your Thought Process - Interviewers often look for how you approach and solve problems, not just the final solution.
